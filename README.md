# datastore_test
Example project showcasing that a robolectric test using datastore fails on windows


This repo contains two tests. First one creating two files and renaming the first to the second one. 
Second one uses DataStore and write twice.

Both tests are working on linux (I tried using wsl ond windows) but fail on windows.
